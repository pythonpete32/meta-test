# AraCred

Please see the [AraCred Deployment page](https://aracred.github.io/website/docs/deploymentOverview/) for info on how to setup and run AraCred.

> Note! AraCred does **not** run on the master branch of SourceCred. It runs on the [SourceCred Discord branch](https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/tree/discord), which at the time of writing, is experimental. As such, expect things to break early and often.
